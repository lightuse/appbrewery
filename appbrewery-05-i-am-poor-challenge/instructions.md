# "I am poor" challenge

This repo is for section 5 of the App Brewery Dart/Flutter course with Angela Yu.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare a place for your own work

```
git checkout -b YOURNAME-solution
```

### Step 2: Initialize this project as a Flutter project

Make your new Flutter project in this project directory.

Do the same thing you did for the "I am rich" project.

Remember, if you want to run a creation command in this project directory, it will look like this:

```
flutter create  -s material.Scaffold.1 \
  --overwrite \
  --org jp.sendai.city \
  --project-name i_am_poor \
  -t app \
  --platforms ios \
  --pub \
  .
```

### Step 3: Commit the starter files

Make an initial `git commit` of the starter files.

### Step 4: Do the challenge

Note: in this "App Brewery" course, the point of a "Challenge" is to customize your work, show your personality and creativity a little bit.

### Step 5: Request review

1. After you have made your last commit...
1. Push your work up to Github 
1. Make a pull request
1. Put the pull request URL under your name in the spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zmhu7XmE0mUKCFqoATB4Cp3aZXwIMAa44oHxXJxk25Q/edit#gid=0
