This repo is for section 3 of the App Brewery Dart/Flutter course with Angela Yu.

## Instructions

### Step 0: Clone this repo locally

Use `git clone` to fetch this repo.

Do NOT "fork" the repo. Just clone it.

### Step 1: Prepare a place for your own work

```
git checkout -b YOURNAME-solution
```

### Step 2: Initialize this project as a Flutter project

Make your new Flutter project in this project directory.

You have two options for how to do this.

#### OPTION #1

Create a Flutter project using Android Studio, then move all the files from that directory into this project directory.

OR 

#### OPTION #2

Run this command in this project directory:

```
flutter create  -s material.Scaffold.1 \
  --overwrite \
  --org jp.sendai.city \
  --project-name i_am_rich \
  -t app \
  --platforms ios \
  --pub \
  .
```

Don't forget the `.` at the end! :D 

### Step 3: Commit the starter files

BEFORE you start any real work... make an initial `git commit` of the starter files.

#### WHY? 

Why? Because that way it is easier to see your actual work, in the commit history.

### Step 4: Do the actual tasks in the App Brewery videos

Finish up to the last step (in this case, "How to Add App Icons to the iOS and Android Projects")... 

#### Important note: Commit regularly

Make sure to regularly commit, after each logical change.  Don't drop one huge commit at the end!

### Step 5: Request review

1. After you have made your last commit...
1. Push your work up to Github 
1. Make a pull request
1. Put the pull request URL under your name in the spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zmhu7XmE0mUKCFqoATB4Cp3aZXwIMAa44oHxXJxk25Q/edit#gid=0
